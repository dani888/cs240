/* i learned with explore.c that numbers repeat,
local and stactic store differntly. I learned how 
to check a pointers adress by printing its adress with
& like so "&array". I learned a little bit about pointers
and how they work. Arrays can be used with arrays and
functions. Pionters are compact and are efficient to code 
with. Pointers can be used to any varaible type. The use of pointers
is to save memory and let the code run faster */
